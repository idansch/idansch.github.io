Upload your app images in this folder.

Required files:
- `echo-logo.png` – logo for the Echo app page

- `bacchus-logo.png` – logo for the Bacchus page (optional)

Recommended specs:
- PNG format, square aspect ratio (1:1)
- Size around 1024×1024 px for best quality
- Place each image directly in this directory so they can be referenced as `images/APP-logo.png` from the HTML pages.
- When displayed, the icons will appear with iOS-style rounded corners and a subtle shadow.
